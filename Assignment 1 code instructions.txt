The code is written in Python, in the form of a Jupyter notebook.
The cells can be run in order (from the top to bottom) in order to get the desired results.

Note that the first cell loads in both the required libraries, as well as the data.
Specifically, the last line in the first cell "df = pd.read_excel ... " may need to have the parameters adjusted in order to find where the Concrete_Data.xls file is located.
Additionally, the required libraries for the program are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn.

The cells titled "Gradient descent and regression for univariate models" and "Gradient descent and regression for multivariate model" print out the results of the models.
For the 8 univariate models, the code will print out the name of the variable, the b and m values, the mse, the training and testing R-squared values, and the plot of the training data with the model on top.
For the multivariate model, the code will print out the b value, the b value, the vector of m value, the mse, and the training and testing R-squared values.

Everything underneath the "Extra credit: pre-processing the data" header relates to the extra credit portion.
This includes creating histograms to compare distributions of the variables, and replications of the univariate and multivariate results from above.
